# Project-1-Vanilla-Options-in-a-BS-World
In this project we develop a Monte Carlo pricing engine for pricing Vanilla options in a Black--Scholes model. The engine is designed using object-oriented techniques and implemented in C++ (using Visual Studio 2022 as the compiler). In particular we allow the flexibility of prescribing the option to be priced, the method of random number generation and the determination of the statistic to be computed by the engine. The engine is also designed in such a way that it would be quite simple to allow for other models of spot evolution.

The relevant code for the project can be found in the various folders attached to the repository. We also provide documentation of the project covering the requisite options pricing and Monte Carlo theory, as well as relevant C++ language features. We also provide documentation of basic features of the python language in addition to a python script for generating plots.

Note the contents of this project essentially cover the first six chapters of the excellent "C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing" by Mark Joshi, albeit with more modern features of the C++ language substituted where appropriate. In particular we make heavy use of unique pointers, lambda expressions and range-based for loops.
